/**
 * ⭐⭐ THE RUNNING THREAD — "tell it what changed".
 *
 * Daniel: "a chat part of it — thought is to have people keep it as a guide, a
 * way to retain people." He is right about the need and I pushed back on the
 * shape, which he accepted: a general chat is another place to ask questions
 * instead of acting, and this product exists to end that state.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ SO THE BOX IS NOT LABELLED "ASK ME ANYTHING". It is labelled with the one
 * thing it is for. The placeholder is three real events, because a blank box
 * with an open invitation gets small talk and a blank box with examples gets
 * the sale falling through.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ AND THE PAYOFF IS A BUTTON, NOT A PARAGRAPH. When something genuinely
 * moves the plan, the reply says what it moved and the REDO appears — the plan
 * gets rewritten on the plan, where it can be found tomorrow. A plan rewritten
 * inside a chat message is a plan nobody can find again.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT STOPS INVITING WHEN IT IS BEING USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR DOING THE MOVE.
 * `stalling` comes back from the model under an explicit rule — three replies
 * that neither changed the plan nor sent them to do something, and the fourth
 * says so. Same spine as the twelve-ask cap on a move: the next real answer is
 * on the other side of trying it.
