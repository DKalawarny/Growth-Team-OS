/**
 * The way out — after the third move.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE ONE PAGE THAT ASKS INSTEAD OF TELLING. Everywhere else this product
 * produces something: a path, a plan, a week of instructions. Here it has
 * nothing left to produce, and the only useful thing it can do is find out
 * whether any of it worked.
 *
 * 🔴🔴 REVISED 28 SEP, AND THE OLD RULE WAS CONFLATING TWO THINGS.
 *
 * It read: "it does not congratulate anybody — three ticked boxes is not the
 * same as being out, and a page that celebrates somebody who is still stuck has
 * stopped listening." The second half of that is still true and still governs.
 * The first half was too wide, and Daniel called it: "finishing is great, there
 * should be a completion congratulations when done, something exciting — but
 * then a page asking you are here now, and questions that lead into the next
 * stage. No one is just done."
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE DISTINCTION IS BETWEEN THE WORK AND THE OUTCOME.
 *   ✅ "You did all three." — a FACT. They ticked them. Most people who make a
 *      plan never finish one, and saying so costs nothing and assumes nothing.
 *   ❌ "You're out." / "Congratulations, you made it." — a claim about their
 *      LIFE that we cannot see and they have not been asked about yet.
 *
 * So the celebration is real, and it is about the three moves and nothing else.
 * The question that follows is still the honest one, and it is asked before any
 * assumption is made about how it went.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ AND NOBODY IS EVER LEFT AT "DONE". The completion is a beat, not a
 * destination: it hands straight to where-are-you-now, which hands to the next
 * plan. That is also the whole commercial logic — this product FINISHES, so the
 * only version of it that continues is one that starts again from what actually
 * happened.
 *
 * ⚠️ Still no score, no streak, no confetti cannon. The register holds: direct
 * about the situation, never directive about the person.
 */
/**
 * 🔴 "these are not the questions i was thinking — this could be better, more
 * uplifting, exciting."
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE FAULT WAS THAT THEY READ AS A REPORT CARD. "Yes — that is where I am"
 * / "I did the work and it did not land" are four ways of being marked, and
 * three of them are a fail. Nobody is lifted by grading themselves.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ SO THEY POINT FORWARD INSTEAD. Each one is a POSITION somebody is standing
 * in, and every one of them leads somewhere — which is true, because the next
 * plan is built differently from each. ⚠️ Still four, still honest, and "it did
 * not land" is still sayable in plain words: softening that one would cost the
 * only answer that teaches us anything.
