 * marketing page — the pages the entire findability strategy depends on — for
 * visitors who will never see this product. Loading them from the route means
 * the cost lands only on the people looking at it.
 *
 * ⚠️ `display=swap` is deliberate: text renders immediately in the fallback and
 * reflows when Figtree arrives. The alternative is a blank screen on a slow
 * connection, and the first thing this product says is "you're not stuck" —
 * showing that late is worse than showing it in the wrong typeface.
 *
 * ⚠️ `noindex` while the name is unsettled. These URLs use the internal slug
 * and the product has no name; letting Google index /wayout now means the
 * rename later orphans whatever it learned, and a half-built paid product in
 * search results is worse than none. Remove the tag deliberately at launch —
 * and add the routes to scripts/sitemap.mjs in the same commit, or they will
 * be orphaned the way the answer pages were.
