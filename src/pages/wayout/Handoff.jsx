/**
 * ⭐ The shared summary, Unstuck Map side (6 Oct 2026). Two quiet cards:
 *  - "Share a few lines with Eliv8 OS": only for someone who runs a business
 *    there. A draft from their own answers, which they edit; only the box is
 *    shared, only with them, only when they press the button.
 *  - "From your business": what they shared from Eliv8 OS, with one button that
 *    tells their plan, through the same "something changed" route as anything
 *    else they say. Their words, so provenance holds.
 * ⚠️ No dashes; never "it" for the product; never implies a person reads it.
