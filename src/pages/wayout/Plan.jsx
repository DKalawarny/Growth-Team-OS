          He is right and it is the worst possible place to stop. `/done` has
          existed since 26 Sep — it asks whether it actually landed and starts the
          next plan from the answer, which is the entire reason a subscription to
          a product that FINISHES makes any sense. **Not one page linked to it.**

          ⚠️ It appears only when every move is ticked. Offering "how did it go"

          still doing. */}

              He is right and the diagnosis is precise: the completion beat I
              built was on `/done`, one click away behind a button that reads
              like admin. But **the moment of finishing is the third tick, and it

              them. A celebration on the next screen is a celebration nobody
              walks into.

              ⭐⭐ So the beat moved to where the event is. Same mark, same

          is being SPECIFIC: it names HIS move one, in his plan's own words, and
