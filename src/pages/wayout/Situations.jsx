 * and what they are running from. These are the door.
 *
 * ⚠️ THEY ARE NOT LANDING PAGES. A landing page answers "what is this product",
 * which nobody types. These answer what somebody actually types at eleven at
 * night, and the test is strict: could a person who will never pay a cent read
 * this and be genuinely better off? If not it does not belong here — that is

 * part to drive a signup loses the citation and the trust at the same time.
