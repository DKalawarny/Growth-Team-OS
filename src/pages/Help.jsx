 * actually confuses owners better than I do. Mark each item ✓ when

const FAQ = [
  {
    q: 'How does Solomon know about my business?',
    a: 'Solomon reads three things every day: the answers you gave during onboarding (industry, revenue, goals), anything you tell it in conversation, and — if you\'ve connected QuickBooks — your live financials. The more specific you are when you check in, the better its advice gets.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why is there a 10-runs-per-month cap on tools?',
    a: `Tools (Cash Flow, Hiring Scorecards, Playbooks, etc.) each make an AI call that costs real money to run. The cap keeps your subscription priced at $${PRICE_MONTHLY_USD} even when you're using it heavily. Most owners use 3–5 runs a month total. If you need more, email me — caps are easy to raise.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need QuickBooks to use GrowthOS?',
    a: 'No. Connecting QuickBooks unlocks the live CFO Dashboard and makes cash flow forecasting automatic, but every other tool works without it. You can connect later from Settings → Integrations, or enter numbers manually.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is my data private? Can you see it?',
    a: 'Each business gets an isolated workspace. Your data is never used to train AI models and is never shared. I can see aggregate usage (which tools are popular, error rates) but I do not read individual workspaces unless you explicitly send me something for support.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I invite my accountant or coach?',
    a: 'Go to Settings → Team & access. Under "Advisor access" generate an invite link and share it. They\'ll create a free account, get read-only access to your workspace, and can see your roadmap and check-ins but cannot edit anything.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I add my employees / techs?',
    a: 'Settings → Team & access → Team card. Add their name, email, and role. They\'ll show up on the Work Board so you can assign tasks and email them updates. Adding staff does not create logins for them — only people you invite as advisors can sign in.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What\'s the difference between a milestone and a task?',
    a: 'Milestones live on your Growth Roadmap — they\'re the big chunks (e.g. "Hire a foreman", "Launch service area in Airdrie"). Tasks live on the Work Board — they\'re the day-to-day work that gets you there ("Post job ad", "Call three references"). Milestones tell you where you\'re going. Tasks tell you what to do today.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I cancel anytime?',
    a: 'Yes. Settings → Billing → Manage billing opens the Stripe portal where you can cancel. Monthly plans stop at the end of the period. Annual plans can cancel renewal any time and keep access until renewal would have happened.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I export my data?',
    a: 'Not self-serve yet — email me at support@leadeos.com and I\'ll send you a CSV of your milestones, tasks, and check-ins within a day. Built-in export is coming.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I think I found a bug / something broke',
    a: 'Email support@leadeos.com with a screenshot if you have one. I read these personally and usually respond same day. Specific is better than general — "the cash flow chart wouldn\'t load after I connected QuickBooks" beats "it\'s not working".',
  },
