/**
 * /demo — a walkthrough anyone can open without a login, so the product can
 * sell itself over time. Daniel, 8 Oct: keep it clean and universal, no jargon,
 * a thriving business so it reads as exciting rather than a warning.
 *
 * ⭐ TWO RULES THIS PAGE IS BUILT AROUND.
 *
 * 1. EVERY NUMBER HERE IS INVENTED, AND THE PAGE SAYS SO — twice, in plain
 *    sight. A demo full of realistic figures is only honest while the reader
 *    knows it is an example. Evergreen Grounds does not exist. There are no
 *    testimonials here and there will not be until real customers give real
 *    quotes with their real names.
 *
 * 2. IT RENDERS THE REAL COMPONENTS. The decision below is the actual
 *    DecisionView from the product fed seeded data, not a screenshot and not a
 *    mock that drifts the first time the real one changes. What a visitor sees
 *    here is what they get when they sign in.
 *
 * ⭐ The example is a thriving landscaping company on purpose: everyone
 *    understands it with no jargon, and the question is about GROWTH, so
 *    Solomon reads as the sharp advisor who makes a good business bigger
 *    without being reckless. He still names the real constraint and what he
 *    cannot see, because an advisor that only flatters is the whole thing this
 *    product refuses to be. The buyer is defined by conviction, not sector
 *    (see lib/seo.js); landscaping is just the clearest example to show.
 *
 * ⚠️ No em dashes in anything a visitor reads (Daniel, "looks AI").

If it does not, you have learned that for the cost of a conversation instead of a year of payroll.\n\nThe one thing I would not do is crew up and promote at the same time under bid pressure.
