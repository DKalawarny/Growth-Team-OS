/**
 * The way out — the six intake screens (SPEC §2).
 *
 * ⭐ THE ORDER IS THE PRODUCT, AND IT IS NOT ALPHABETICAL OR CONVENIENT.
 * Constraints come first (S1), then the people affected (S2), then what they
 * already own (S3), then money (S4), then what they would trade (S5), and only
 * at the end where they want to end up (S6). Most products of this shape ask
 * for the dream first because it is the pleasant question. Asking it first
 * produces a plan they cannot follow — and worse, it teaches them to answer the
 * constraint questions in a way that protects the dream they just described.
 *
 * ⚠️ Screens are DATA, not six hand-written components. Six near-identical
 * components is six places for the validation, the reflection card, the back
 * button and the progress count to drift apart, and this is the part of the
 * product most likely to be reworded weekly.
 *
 * Field kinds:
 *   chips       multi-select, with `allowCustom` for "+ Add your own"
 *   choice      single-select
 *   rank        drag to order
 *   number      currency input
 *   text        free text (textarea)
 *   shorttext   free text (single line)
 *
 * `required: true` blocks Next and shows the inline message from `emptyMessage`.

 * The open door — the last step, after the six questions.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ WHY IT IS LAST AND NOT FIRST. Asked cold at the start, "tell me about
 * your life" gets a shrug and two lines — nobody knows what kind of detail
 * matters yet. Asked after six specific questions, and immediately after "what
 * are you running from and running toward", people know exactly what this thing
 * is for and write the real thing. The most useful sentence in the whole intake
 * usually lands here.
 *
 * ⭐ It is also the only field that can carry what no list can: an illness, a
 * bankruptcy, a marriage that is ending, a record, a kid who needs more than
 * the others, the job that is about to go. Every one of those changes the plan,
 * and none of them is a chip.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT NUMBERED, so the promise on the opening screen — "six honest
 * questions" — stays true. It is a door, not a seventh interrogation.
 *
 * 🔴🔴 NOW REQUIRED, REVERSING THE CALL BELOW — and the old reasoning is kept
 * because it was not wrong, just answered.
 *
 * It used to read: "NOT REQUIRED. A forced life story gets 'n/a', and then we
 * have taught them the box is a formality." Daniel, 27 Sep: "it can't be
 * negotiable — this dictates the whole platform." He is right, and the audit
 * that followed proved it: of eleven prompted free-text questions in this file,
 * TEN were optional. Somebody could finish the entire intake having typed two
 * sentences, and every guard downstream treats only their own words as facts
 * they gave us — chips have never counted. So the thing the plan is built from
 * was the thing easiest to skip.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE FEAR WAS REAL AND THE FIX IS NOT OPTIONALITY, IT IS A FLOOR. Anything
 * is accepted, including a few words. What is refused is nothing at all. A
 * one-word answer still tells the plan something; an empty box tells it that
 * the most important field in the product was a formality.
