/**
 * src/lib/seo.js — single source of truth for site-wide SEO configuration.
 *
 * Why centralize this:
 *   - Domain changes once when we move to a real production URL.
 *   - Keyword sets are reused across page meta, schema, llms.txt, and copy.
 *   - JSON-LD schema helpers stay consistent — Google + AI assistants parse
 *     them, so getting the shape right matters more than the wording.
 *
 * Where this gets consumed:
 *   - src/pages/Landing.jsx, Pricing.jsx, marketing/CRM.jsx — <Helmet> blocks
 *   - public/sitemap.xml, public/llms.txt — manually kept in sync (small list)
 *   - public/robots.txt — references SITEMAP_URL
 *
 * If you add a new public page, do three things:
 *   1. Add a <Helmet> block in the page using buildPageMeta()
 *   2. Add the URL to PUBLIC_PAGES below
 *   3. Add it to public/sitemap.xml
 *
 * Keyword philosophy:
 *   ⚠️ This changed with the reposition. The buyer is no longer defined by
 *   SECTOR (a plumber, a roofer) but by CONVICTION — a Christian owner who
 *   wants the business run a particular way. That axis cuts across every
 *   industry, so ranking for "AI advisor for HVAC contractors" now brings
 *   the wrong visitor to a page that will not speak to them.
 *
 *   So: rank on the conviction terms, stay industry-neutral in the general
 *   copy, and keep a SHORT trades list only because /for/:trade pages still
 *   exist and trades are Daniel's actual network — not as the wedge.
 *
 *   The old list enumerated ~55 verticals for breadth. Breadth against the
 *   wrong axis is not reach, it is noise.
