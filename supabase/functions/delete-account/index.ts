/**
 * delete-account — actually deletes an account.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS. The Settings → Danger "Delete workspace" button told the
 * owner "Permanently delete this workspace and all data — milestones,
 * documents, financial records, and advisor memory. This cannot be undone",
 * made them type DELETE, said "Deleting your workspace…" — and then ran
 * `supabase.auth.signOut()`. Nothing was ever deleted. Someone who had trusted
 * us with their books was told those books were gone while they sat untouched
 * in the database. On this product, of all products.
 *
 * The browser cannot do this: deleting an auth user needs the service role, and
 * a service-role key can never be shipped to a client. Hence an Edge Function.
 *
 * ── What gets deleted, and what deliberately does not ──────────────────────
 *
 * SOLE OWNER (no other profile on the company):
 *   the company row is deleted, and 22 tables cascade off companies(id) — the
 *   roadmap, documents, check-ins, knowledge files, advisor memory, work
 *   orders, usage. Then the auth user, which cascades profiles(id).
 *
 * NOT THE ONLY MEMBER:
 *   only this person is removed. The company and its data belong to the people
 *   still in it, and one member leaving must never delete their colleagues'
 *   business records. work_orders.created_by / assigned_to go null rather than
 *   taking the job history with them (migration 033).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ORDER MATTERS. Company first, auth user second. Doing it the other way
 * cascades the profile away, and the company lookup that decides sole-ownership
 * no longer has a profile to find — you would orphan the company and every row
 * hanging off it, silently, with the account gone and nobody able to reach it.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO ADMIN PATH. This deletes the CALLER, resolved from their own JWT. There
 * is deliberately no "delete user X" parameter: a body-supplied id would make
 * this an account-deletion weapon behind one forged request.
